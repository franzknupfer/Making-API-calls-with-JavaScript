This repository demonstrates three basic techniques for making API calls using JavaScript for week 2 JavaScript.

Branch 1: Using a `XMLHttpRequest` with a callback.
Branch 2: Using jQuery's ``.ajax()`` with callbacks in ``.ajax()``'s `success` and `error` options.
Branch 3: Using jQuery's `.get()` with a promise (`.then()`, not instantiating a new `Promise` object).
